# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
This task was about setting up and testing my mobile development environment using the **Expo Framework** for React Native.  
Since mobile development requires more resources than web development, Expo Go makes it easier to test apps directly on my phone without worrying about heavy emulators.

## Prerequisites I Already Had
Before starting this task, I already had:
- Node.js LTS installed  
- VS Code as my IDE  
- A compatible OS (Linux in my case)  

With those ready, I could now focus on installing and testing Expo Go on my physical device.

## Why I’m Using Expo Go
I learned that unlike web apps that run in the browser, mobile apps usually need emulators to test. Setting up emulators for both iOS and Android devices can be resource-heavy and sometimes frustrating.  
Instead of worrying about that, Expo Go allows me to scan a QR code and instantly preview my React Native app on my own phone (Android or iOS). This is much faster and more cost-effective.

## Steps I Took

1. I visited the Expo Go homepage: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go).  
2. I made sure I was looking at the latest Expo SDK version.  
3. I installed **Expo Go** on my device:  
   - On Android → from the **Google Play Store**  
   - (iOS users would install from the App Store)  
4. After installing, I opened the Expo Go app.  
5. I created a new Expo account (you can also log in if you already have one).

## My Setup Verification
Once Expo Go was installed and I logged in, I was able to see the Expo dashboard on my device.  
Later, I’ll be able to run `npx expo start` in my project and scan the QR code with Expo Go to preview my apps directly on my phone.

## Challenges I Faced
- *(This is where I’d document any actual issues I encountered. For example: slow download from the Play Store, difficulty scanning QR codes, or login errors. If I didn’t face any issues, I’d just note that the setup went smoothly.)*

## Reflection
Completing this step made me realize how much easier Expo Go makes mobile development. Instead of spending hours setting up emulators, I can now focus directly on writing and testing code. I’m confident this setup will help me move faster in the upcoming React Native projects.
